						<h5>Network Topology</h5>

						<p><img src="{{site.url}}/figures/setup/setup.svg" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width=90%;" alt="network topology"/></p>
						<h3>Hardware</h3>

						<p>All tree nodes are equipped with identical hardware consisting of:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>SoC: Intel Xeon D-1518 CPU</li>
							<li>Dual port Intel X552 NIC (10G Ethernet)</li>
							<li>32 GiB RAM</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Topology</h3>

						<p>The setup consists of three nodes:<p>

						<ul>
							<li>Load generator (LoadGen): runs MoonGen, creates traffic for the DuT and receives the traffic from the DuT</li>
							<li>Device under test (DuT): forwards the traffic received from the LoadGen between its interfaces</li>
							<li>Timestamper (TS): Receives a copy of every packet exchanged between LoadGen and DuT for timestamping which is done in hardware using the capabilities of the X552 NIC</li>
						</ul>

						<p>DuT and LoadGen are directly connected via optical fibers. The TS is connected via passive optical taps to mirror both fibers between DuT and LoadGen. The passive optical taps have a neglegible impact on latency and no impact on the variance of the delay.</p>
